Zima／Cassini／This was where I began.[n]A crude little machine with barely enough intelligence to steer itself.[n]But it was my world.[n]It was all I knew,all Ineed to know.[n][n]To extract some simple pleasure from the execution of a task well done.[n][n]My search for truth is finished at last.[n]I·m going home.／／／／／2023-11-17
